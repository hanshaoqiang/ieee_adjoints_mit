# Efficient Adjoint Computation for Wavelet and Convolution Operators
This repository contains only our code which is used in the IEEE Signal Processing Magazine Lecture Note "Efficient Adjoint Computation for Wavelet and Convolution Operators", by James Folberth and Stephen Becker.

Please see [ieee_adjoints](https://github.com/jamesfolberth/ieee_adjoints) for the complete code, which can be used to reproduce the the figures in our lecture note.  The only purpose of this repository is to provide more permissive, MIT licensed access to our code.
